		<p>This is the Shipping Blockchain's home page.
			<p>All
				<mark>Participants</mark> must be created in order to create
				<b>
					<a [routerLink]="['/Nomination']">Nomination</a>
				</b>.</p>
			<p>After a Nomination is created, it needs to be verified by the
				<b>Captain</b> in order to do Loading, Discharging and Sending Email</p>
			<p>
				<b>Nomination</b> - is where Voyage Managers enter the data from the text field. It is then email to their superior for
				validation purposes.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Discharge</b> - is where it keeps the reference ID from Nomination and records the timestamp of the Hose Connection and
				Hose Disconnection where the user can also Generate/Send Invoices to the according Participants.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Loading</b> - combines both the Nomination's and Discharge's numerical data and does function calculations which adds
				the additional pay to the grand total.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Invoice</b> - prints out all the information gathered from Nomination, Discharge, and Loading and gets emailed to the
				according participants.</p>
