		<p>This is the Shipping Blockchain's home page.
		<p>All <mark>Participants</mark> must be created in order to create <b><a [routerLink]="['/Nomination']">Nomination</a></b>.</p>
		<p>After a Nomination is created, it needs to be verified by the <b>Captain</b> in order to do Loading, Discharging and Sending Email</p>
		<p><b>Nomination</b> - is where Voyage Managers enter the data from the text field. It is then email to their superior for validation purposes.</p>
		<p><b>Discharge</b> - is where it keeps the reference ID from Nomination and records the timestamp of the Hose Connection and Hose Disconnection where the user can also Generate/Send Invoices to the according Participants.</p>
		<p><b>Loading</b> - combines both the Nomination's and Discharge's numerical data and does function calculations which adds the additional pay to the grand total.</p>
		<p><b>Invoice</b> - prints out all the information gathered from Nomination, Discharge, and Loading and gets emailed to the according participants.</p>
		<br />
